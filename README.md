# TicTacToe
First functional game I made in C#
* The game automatically starts when running the application.
  1. Player 1 always starts with the 'X' game piece, and Player 2 always has the 'O' piece
  2. When a player reaches 3 in a row, the squares where the match occurs lights up in red
  3. A message box appears and congratulates the player, and the game ends (the application can be terminated)
  4. If no player wins, a tie message shows up, and no squares light up in red
